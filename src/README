To build FTPlib on linux, type 'make'.  This should produce a shared
library and a static library.  It should also create the qftp
executable.  'make install' should install into /usr/local.  To
install elsewhere, modify the Makefile.

To build on MAC, type 'make static'.  This should build a static link
library and qftp.static.

The provided Makefile may work on other unix-like systems although it
will most likely require some modifications.

To build on OpenVMS, some extra files are provided.  DESCRIP.MMS can
be used with MMS or MMK.  Options files are provied for VAX, Alpha and
Itanium systems.

This release was not tested on Microsoft Windows.  Previous releases
have built without any problems and I don't believe any significant
changes have ocurred that should cause this release to fail.  To build
on Windows using Visual Studio, create a library project for FTPlib
and a command line executable project qftp.  Add a dependency from
qftp to FTPlib.  'Build All' should create working files.

Also not tested but the provided Makefile will probably work with
Cygwin.
